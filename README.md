### About Me

Hey there! I'm Michael Mahumba, an 18-year-old high school student hailing from the vibrant city of Francistown, Botswana. Last December, during my school break, I stumbled upon the captivating world of coding, and since then, I've been on an exhilarating journey of learning and exploration.

I have a multitude of interests that keep me engaged outside the classroom. As an avid gamer, I find joy and excitement in immersive virtual worlds. When I'm not gaming, you can often find me buried in a good book, expanding my horizons and delving into new realms of knowledge. Additionally, I'm a passionate tech enthusiast, fascinated by the ever-evolving landscape of technology and its endless possibilities.

Currently, I'm on a quest to enhance my coding skills, fueled by curiosity and a drive for self-improvement. Whether it's mastering new programming languages or tackling challenging projects, I'm always eager to expand my skill set and embrace the complexities of software development.

Feel free to connect with me on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/thabomahumba.michael/) to share ideas, discuss tech trends, or simply chat about our latest gaming conquests. Let's embark on this coding journey together!
